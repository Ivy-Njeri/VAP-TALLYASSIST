    <h2>Topic 1:What is Inventory?</h2>
    <p>Inventory, in a business context, refers to the goods and materials a company holds for sale or uses in production. It encompasses a range of items, including raw materials, work-in-progress, and finished goods. Essentially, inventory represents the assets a company has available for its operations, and its management is crucial for smooth functioning and profitability. 
        <h3>Here are the various forms in which inventories are held:</h3>
        
<h4>🧱Raw Materials:</h4>
<p>These are the basic inputs used in the production process, like wood for furniture or fabric for clothing. </p>
<h4>⚒️Work-in-Progress (WIP):</h4>
<p>This category includes partially completed products that are undergoing production.</p>
<h4>🚗Finished Goods:</h4>
<p>These are the completed products ready for sale to customers.</p> 
<h4>🏭Maintenance, Repair, and Operating (MRO) supplies:</h4>
<p>These are the items used to maintain and repair the means of production, like tools and lubricants. </p>
<p>Inventory is a current asset on a company's balance sheet, meaning it's expected to be converted to cash within a year.</p>
<h3> Effective inventory management is essential to: </h3>
<ul>
<li>Meet customer demand: Ensuring sufficient stock to fulfill orders promptly. </li>
<li>Minimize costs: Balancing the need for enough inventory with the costs of storage and potential obsolescence.</li>
<li>Optimize cash flow: Balancing the need to invest in inventory with the need to maintain healthy cash flow. </li>
</ul>
 <h2>Topic 2: Inventory and Stock Management (Stock Items)</h2>
  <p>This module covers how to manage stock or inventory effectively in Tally. Managing stock correctly ensures accurate financial statements and control over goods movement. Here's a step-by-step guide:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>1. Enabling Inventory Features:</strong> Go to F11: Features > Inventory Features. Enable stock tracking, multiple godowns, and batch-wise details if required.</li>
    <li><strong>2. Creating Stock Groups:</strong> Navigate to Gateway of Tally > Inventory Info > Stock Groups > Create. Stock groups help categorize items like Electronics, Clothing, Food Items, etc.</li>
    <li><strong>3. Creating Units of Measure:</strong> Define whether items are sold in pieces, kilograms, liters, etc. Go to Gateway > Inventory Info > Units of Measure > Create. E.g., nos, kg, litre.</li>

<h2>Topic 3:Inventory Management</h2>
<p>Inventory management is the process of overseeing, controlling, and tracking a company's goods and materials to ensure an optimal balance between supply and demand. It involves managing the flow of goods from purchasing and storing to using and selling them. Effective inventory management is crucial for minimizing costs, preventing stockouts, and improving overall business efficiency.</p>

<li>Tracking: Monitoring inventory levels, locations, and status (e.g., raw materials, work-in-progress, finished goods). </li>
<li>Using/Selling: Ensuring inventory is available to meet production needs or customer demand.</li> 
<li>Restocking: Replenishing inventory when levels get low, using techniques like reorder points or just-in-time inventory. </li>
</ul>
<h3>📕Importance of Inventory Management:</h3>

<h3>Different Inventory Management Methods:</h3>
<h4>⌚Just-in-Time (JIT):</h4>
<p>Ordering materials or components only when needed for production or sale.</p>
<h4>🗓️Materials Requirement Planning (MRP):</h4>
<p>A system for planning and managing materials based on production schedules and demand forecasts.</p>
<h4>👌Economic Order Quantity (EOQ):</h4>
